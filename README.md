# Predicting Stock Price in Pyhton Project

 I would like to study stock price estimation on the financial market. Firstly, I prepare a timeseries data with respect to looking at the historical data by using Linear Regression method. Linear Regression focuses on two variables that are dependent and independent. Dependent variable implies the target and the independent variable implies feature. I would like to estimate the price of stock in financial market with the daily data and then make a restriction such as 30 days, 60 days and etc., which enables to forecast future price movement up or down. It can be seen as a signal. 

 Moreover, I researched the method that is used to estimate stock price. I found  the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method being an area of Machine Learning. This method is mainly talk about the interaction between environment and the result. The idea behind the RL interacting with the environment many times and getting the reward or penalty with respect to action result, then it will find the optimal way and result by gaining experience. In this method has so many submethod but i want to work Quality-table (Q-table).
